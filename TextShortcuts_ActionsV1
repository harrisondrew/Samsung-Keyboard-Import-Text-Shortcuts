This program is written around using Action in AutoInput as opposed to Actions v2. The program in v2 was unable to read and 
output data such as _(  _)  ^( and ^) because of the open parentheses, I don't know why Actions is able to work with it but
it does so use this if you're struggling to enter specific values. 
Be aware that Actions are about 2.5 times slower than Actions v2 so if you have a massive dataset try do most with the other 
program listed.
